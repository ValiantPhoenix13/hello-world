# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow, and writing down ideas.

Some info about me:
I've recently graduated from SAC State with my BS in Computer Science. During my time at SAC State I spent my time acquiring knowledge about OS, networking,
AI training and models, software development methodologies, databases, and web development. Some of the big projects I've developed included working on 
making a basic game engine, two websites, and a localserver chatroom.

I have huge passions for video games and board games, most of my free time is spent playing one of the two. As a result, I want my career path to focus on
game develpment. In pursuit of this goal I've been studying Blender and finishing up courses to help familiarize myself with the workspace. Then taking
that knowledge to create assets to make a game in Godot.
